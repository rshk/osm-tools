OSM tools
#########

Repository containing source code of the osmconvert, osmfilter and osmupdate tools,
along with a Makefile to quickly build them.

Disclaimer
==========

I did not write any of them, I just put them here to keep at hand / track changes /
be able to quickly upgrade them on multiple machines.

License notes are contained on top of the source files.

To the original author: please put the updated source in a repository somewhere :)
(if it's already, I beg you pardon, but wasn't able to find it..).


Usage
=====

Just clone the repo, enter the directory and run ``make``.
